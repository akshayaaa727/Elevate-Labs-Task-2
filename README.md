## ðŸ”Ž Observations from EDA

- Most passengers were young adults (20â€“40 years).  
- Fare distribution is right-skewed, with some very high-value outliers.  
- Females had much higher survival chances compared to males.  
- 1st class passengers survived more often than 3rd class passengers.  
- Majority of passengers boarded at Southampton (S), but survival was higher for Cherbourg (C).  
- Fare is strongly correlated with Pclass, which indicates ticket price differences among classes.  
- Outliers in Fare exist (VIP/luxury tickets).  
- Pclass and Fare show multicollinearity, so feature selection is important in ML models.
